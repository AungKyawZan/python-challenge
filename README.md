Financial Data Analysis:

Analyzes a CSV file (budget_data.csv) to calculate:
- Total months
- Total revenue
- Average monthly change
- Greatest increase and decrease in profits

Election Data Analysis:
Analyzes a CSV file (election_data.csv) to calculate:
- Total votes
- Vote percentage for each candidate
- Winner of the election

Output: Results are printed to the console and saved to a text file (save_file.txt) for both analyses.
